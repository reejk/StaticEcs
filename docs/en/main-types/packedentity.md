PackedEntity packedEntity = entity.Pack();
// Attempt to unpack an entity in the world whose identifier is specified via the type parameter, returns true if the entity is successfully unpacked, in out unpacked entity
if (packedEntity.TryUnpack<WorldType>(out var unpackedEntity)) {
    // ...
}

PackedEntity packedEntity2 = entity.Pack();
bool equals = packedEntity.Equals(packedEntity2);     // Verify the identity of the packaged entities
```
